Bootstrapping a Buildout 1-6 release
====================================

**A lot of work has been done on Buildout lately.**

Most notably:

-  Jim Fulton is `working on Buildout 2`_.
-  Ross Patterson has greatly `improved Buildout performance`_.
-  Domen Ko≈æar has `provided a patch`_ that takes a conservative
   approach to Ross's performance improvements.
-  I have offered to do a release.

And there are a `handful of other changes`_ in `trunk on svn.zope.org`_, of which my favorite is:

    The buildout init command now accepts distribution requirements and
    paths to set up a custom interpreter part that has the distributions
    or parts in the path. For example:: $ python bootstrap.py init
    BeautifulSoup

So with that, I am **planning to do a zc.buildout 1.6 release within 24 hours** or so of now. Please add a comment or weigh in on `distutils-sig`_ if you object. We have run the tests on Windows, and discovered only pre-existing failures. We are also preparing to do "Buildout 2 prophylactic releases" (i.e. releases that make 1.x continue to work when 2.x is released) in the 1.6.x series.
