**Including many Plone add-ons.**

Hi. My name is Alex "please don't call them products" Clark. But you may call me aclark or aclark4life. In the spirit of continuing the `great git migration`_, and in order to `beta test pythonpackages.com`_, I've just moved the last of my Subversion repositories to GitHub. This means `any package I have Owner or Maintainer permission for on PyPI`_ now lives in one of 8 GitHub organizations, or my personal GitHub account on github.com. Great Success!

PLONE DEVS: Y U NO MOVE REPOS?
------------------------------

The Plone AI team has tentatively scheduled the end-of-2012 as the time to flip `svn.plone.org/svn/collective`_ to read only (/plone and /archetypes are already read only). So if you are still using the old collective, please take a minute to start thinking about migrating. As always, I'm happy to provide assistance to anyone that needs it to move their code. (I'm in #plone on irc.freenode.net or you can email aclark@aclark.net.)
