**Join us on IRC**

Join us this Saturday in irc://irc.freenode.net#PxC at 4:00AM EDT to work on Plone.org upgrade issues, including:

- Deploying the latest PloneSoftwareCenter code to new.plone.org and testing `collective.dist`_ against new.plone.org/products.
- Develop and test collective.psc.mirroring. This is the PloneSoftwareCenter module responsible for copying uploads to dist.plone.org.
- Develop and test `collective.psc.blobstorage`_ and `collective.psc.externalstorage`_ and collective.psc.filestorage (which does not exist yet). These are the modules responsible for implementing pluggable storage in PloneSoftwareCenter.

.. _collective.dist: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.dist/0.1.9
.. _collective.psc.blobstorage: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.psc.blobstorage
.. _collective.psc.externalstorage: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.psc.externalstorage/
