**Thank You**

Thanks again to everyone who contributed to my travel fund, I really appreciate it. Being able to work closely with Tarek Ziad√© and Matthew Wilkes on PloneSoftwareCenter and PloneOrg was amazing, productive, and fun. Of course being in the company of all the sprinters was a pleasure, and thank you Christophe for the hospitality.

- Matthew and Tarek worked on getting PloneSoftwareCenter ready to host Python packages.
- I worked on creating and configuring the new site instance.
- Steve McMahon and I converted the remaining dependencies from Zope products to Python packages.
