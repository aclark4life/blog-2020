Fix for Spaces in Mac OS X Leopard
==================================

**Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. App**

I primarily develop on Mac OS X and immediately install updates when they are released, including major version upgrades like Leopard. Overall I have been very happy with Leopard but there is one feature I don't like: the automatic window switching functionality in Spaces. However with Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. I can switch to a new space and open a new Terminal window without being automatically taken to another space running another Terminal. The only catch is the Terminal application has to be in focus else the old "wrong" behavior still applies.
