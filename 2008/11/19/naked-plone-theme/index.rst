**Products.naked_plone**

I've needed this for some time, but I'm finally getting around to `shipping it <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.naked_plone/0.1>`_.

In addition to making it easy to disable default Plone styles, this add-on provides an "Advanced Setup" site action. The action is disabled by default, but you can enable it in ``portal_actions -> site_actions``. It adds a "placeful" ``string:manage_main`` link so you can access the ZMI wherever you happen to be on the site.
