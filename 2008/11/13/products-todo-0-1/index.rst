**A project to jump start my return to Plone development.**

I needed a project to jump start my return to Plone after spending months organizing `Plone Conference 2008`_, and wanted to see an add-on's development through from start to finish including:

- Generating boilerplate Buildout and add-on code with Paster.
- Develop some simple functionality for Plone.
- Releasing to pypi.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed or desired.

I also wanted to:

- Include the ``buildout.cfg`` file in the add-on so I could easily add buildbot.
- Write some tests for this code so I could practice TDD.
- Release to new.plone.org so we can finish the plone.org upgrade.

I'm off to a good start. Next steps:

- Get some feedback.
- Edit my ``.pypirc`` and add new.plone.org and make a release.
- Add a buildbot.
- Write some tests.
