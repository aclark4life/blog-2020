**Tonight ex-Zope Corporation developer Chris McDonough unveils his BFG**

From the `docs`_, BFG is:

- is a **Python web application framework**.
- is inspired by Zope’s publisher, though it is less ambitious in scope.
- relies heavily on Zope libraries and WSGI.
- **Familiarity**: As web developers, we’ve become accustomed to working in very particular ways (primarily using Zope 2) over the years. This framework is a canonization of practices that “fit our brains”.
