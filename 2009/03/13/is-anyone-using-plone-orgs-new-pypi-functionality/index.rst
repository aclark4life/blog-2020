Is Anyone Using plone.org's New PyPI Functionality?
===================================================

**python setup.py upload -r plone.org**

Lots of exciting things are happening with Plone.org!

#. `Calvin Hendryx-Parker`_ and `Six Feet Up`_ are working on moving \*.plone.org to one of their powerful new servers (with some exceptions, most notably {svn,dev}.plone.org will remain in place, as I understand it)!
#. `Alex Limi`_ and `company`_ are working on deploying a new look and feel using a new-fangled technology called xdv (a variant of Deliverance).
#. I am removing `kinks`_ that have been lingering after the recent upgrade (in theory ;-).

This blog entry is both a "call to arms" to everyone involved in helping, and a message to everyone waiting patiently that we haven't forgotten about you! :-D

In particular, I'd like to hear from any early adopters of the new `http://plone.org/products`_\ section. You can read about how to use the new PyPI functionality here, if you haven't already: `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.dist/0.2.2`_. In my little "test" product, I found it quite useful: `http://plone.org/products/Products.todo/.`_

So if you are using it, I'd definitely like to hear your experiences. Or if not, please give it a try!
