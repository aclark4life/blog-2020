**Plumbing Zope into the WSGI Pipeline**

As Paul Everitt `recently`_ `mentioned`_, the `dudes`_ are back. Three self-described graybeards doing what they love: Zope. But this is not your father's Zope. This is Repoze, which integrates Zope technologies with WSGI and reusable Python middleware. `One of the dudes`_ will be delivering the first of a two part presentation on `Repoze`_ tonight in DC. Next month, he'll be joined by `the other dude`_ and possibly Paul Everitt himself.
