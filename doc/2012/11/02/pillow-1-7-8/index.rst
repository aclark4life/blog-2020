**Pillow is the friendly PIL fork. Initially just a packaging fork, now considering image code bug fixes and Python 3 support. To be friendly, we attempt to track changes against upstream tickets in PIL.**

Pillow 1.7.8 is out! Read about it here:

- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/1.7.8

Features
--------

- It's PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- It installs on all modern systems [1]_
- Win32 eggs are provided (special thanks to Takayuki Shimizukawa)

Changes
-------

This release includes:

- Removed doctests.py that made tests of other packages fail. [thomasdesvenain]
- Fix opening psd files with RGBA layers when A mode is not of type 65535 but 3. Fixes issue https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow/issues/3 [thomasdesvenain]

Install
-------

To install Pillow::

    $ easy_install Pillow

Or::

    $ pip install Pillow

Or::

    $ python setup.py install (inside the extracted zip)

Or::

    $ pip install zc.buildout
    $ buildout init

With ``buildout.cfg``::

    [buildout]
    parts = pillow

    [pillow]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg

And::

    $ buildout

(Note: easy_install & pip each handle namespace packages differently, so you should choose one or the other, and not mix the two.)
