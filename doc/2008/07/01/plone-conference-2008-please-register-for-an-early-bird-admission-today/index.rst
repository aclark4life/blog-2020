**Join 300-400 of your closest friends for a 7-day party**

Organizing a `Plone Conference`_ is a lot like planning to invite 300-400 of your closest friends over for a 7-day long party, or, at least, it feels that way to me. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone in DC in just a few short months, and I'm very excited about all the possibilities. From the pre-conference training, to the post conference sprint, to all the good food/drink/people/places to enjoy in between. This promises to be one of the biggest and best Plone Conferences ever.

To that end, I'd like to invite everyone to participate in the early bird registration now open at: `http://ploneconf2008.eventbrite.com`_ and I encourage everyone to register right now. We need the support of everyone in the Plone community to make this conference a success.

From spreading the word, to purchasing tickets, to sponsoring the conference itself, if you are reading this, you can help. Securing early bird registrations is a key part of the planning process; it allows us to move forward to the next phase.

And finally, a huge thanks to everyone for your support. I continue to be amazed by the spirit of the community, and I really appreciate the opportunity to work on things like `Plone Conference 2008`_ and upgrading plone.org (which I will have more information about soon, but until then, please poke around on: `http://new.plone.org/`_ or check out `Tarek's most recent blog entry`_ or Jens' most recent mail to the website list: `http://www.nabble.com/plone.org-buildout-refactored-to18266816s6747.html`_. We have scheduled July 19th as the tentative "go live" date.)

So without further ado, please head over to `http://ploneconf2008.eventbrite.com`_ to secure your place at the conference, and help the planning team move forward. See you all in DC!
