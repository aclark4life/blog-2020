Help Eric Steele Go To Baarn
============================

**Because I was there once too**

A few years back, I was `invited to the Baarn UI Sprint 2007.`_ This was a huge turning point for me and Plone. Having just attended the `annual conference in Seattle`_, I was raring to contribute. And in getting invited, I felt like a Catholic getting invited to the Vatican to hang out with the Pope (well 1/2 the Pope at least, aka `Limi`_ ;-)). You cannot beat the awesomeness of the Plone community and the fact that if you give something to it, you will get it back ten-fold in:

-  Knowledge and skills (You can acquire a ton of technical skill by learning the Plone).
-  Kindness from strangers (People will help you do things, like attend a development sprint in another country, amazing).
-  Employment for life (There is more Plone work than there are Plone developers, and I don't see this changing anytime soon).

Which brings me to the subject at hand. One of our own, Eric Steele (author of the amazing development tool `Gloworm`_, and member of the extremely Plone friendly web group called `WebLion`_) needs your help!  Last I spoke with Eric he had reached 60% of his desired goal, so let's help him get to the finish line (by Wednesday).

You can (and probably should, if you can afford it ;-) donate a little something here: `http://www.theartofbeingstill.com/help-me-get-to-baarn`_

I can imagine only good things to come for Plone as a result of Eric attending this event (in fact, Weblion is funding the trip, donations are for food and incidentals if I recall correctly).

So please help! :-D
