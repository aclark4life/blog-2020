**Blog functionality for Sphinx**

After years of using Pelican for blogging and Sphinx for everything else, I became annoyed that Pelican's `File metadata format <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html#file-metadata>`_ did not match Sphinx's `directives <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html#directives>`_. Around the same time, I noticed that `ABlog <http://ablog.readthedocs.org/>`_ had matured enough to be usable.

So late last year I began converting all my Pelican metadata to Sphinx directives, and did quite a bit of clean up as well. I'm finally finished, and now ready to present the results (**ta-da**). Thank you Pelican for all the years of service, and thank you ABlog for helping me use Sphinx for blogging!
