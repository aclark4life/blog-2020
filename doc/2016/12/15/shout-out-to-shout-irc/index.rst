Backlog
-------

A few years ago, I got old and gave up running command line IRC clients. I've run them all or at least a lot of them, including one `whose name is almost certainly in the crosshairs of political correctness <http://www.bitchx.com/>`_. Most recently I ran Weechat and irssi before that. For a while, I gave up IRC completely because I couldn't be bothered. But I missed it, and nothing else seemed to suffice. I tried Slack and thought it was OK, but not IRC. I tried various web clients, but couldn't find one I could stand to use long term. Then `Shout IRC <http://shout-irc.com/>`_ came along.

Stay online
-----------

I tried Shout for the first time over a year ago, but never bothered to create a Shout account on my server. This was a mistake, since user account creation enables one of Shout's most powerful features: `Stay online on IRC even when you log out <http://shout-irc.com/docs/server/users.html>`_.

Configuration
-------------

I had gotten annoyed with having to login each time, so I stopped using Shout for a while. I heard good things about Kiwi, but was disappointed to see `no npm release <https://www.npmjs.com/package/kiwiirc>`_. This led me back to Shout, which `does have an npm release <https://www.npmjs.com/package/shout>`_. What follows are configuration details for `irc.aclark.net <https://irc.aclark.net>`_, for posterity. (I added `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_ at the last minute for good measure.)

Todo
----

I'm currently running ``shout --private`` in `screen <https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`_, but may eventually add a `systemd <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`_ service for it.
