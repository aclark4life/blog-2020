**How I learned to stop worrying and use the right tool for the job.**

My first blog entry was `well over two years ago`_. I've learned enough Plone since then to know that I hardly know anything. Toward the end of 2009, I began to realize that I was doing way too much, and not getting anything done as a result. So I began offloading services wherever I could to free or low cost service providers; I can't tell you how much happier I have been since then.

Interestingly, after waffling over the use of these services for years, when push came to shove I had no problem choosing the right tool for the job. It didn't matter so much what selection I made. The fact that I offloaded the responsibility was the most important thing. Which brings me back to the subject at hand. I love `Plone`_. I think it is great software. I want to make it better. In order to do that I need to broaden my horizons and use the right tool for the job, and hopefully bring those experiences back to Plone! Hence, introducing my new Wordpress-powered blog **about** Plone. I'm still using Plone for `aclark.net`_. I just don't want to "manage" the blog software anymore. I want it done for me so I can focus on other things. Since WordPress is so obviously the leading "best" weblog software, it was an easy decision to make. (Of course, this blog was shipped using `Python software`_.) Lastly, I'll say this. I want to be more prolific in 2010, and I'm hoping that using the right tool for the job will help me achieve that. It has worked wonders so far.
