=======================================

**I have yet to finish my obligations to Plone Conference 2008 until NOW.**

I have yet to finish my obligations to `Plone Conference 2008`_ until NOW: approximately 2 years, 6 months, and 23 days after the end of the post-conference sprint.

The story
---------

We had some trouble with the video company and I had to hunt them down to get copies of missing talks. We still didn't get everything, but this is the last of what we did get. I got these missing DVDs about a year ago, and since then I've been trying to find the time to upload them to `blip.tv`_. Invariably, I got stuck on some aspect of the conversion process so I decided to "give up" and just upload the ripped copies to `dist.plone.org`_.

As such, if anyone in the community has the time and expertise to convert these to Quicktime format, I would greatly appreciate it, and I would be happy to upload the results to blip.tv (this is how we did it the first time if I recall correctly.) Until then, they have at least reached their final resting place, and folks can get access to them if they are interested, here:

-  `WebLion: Bringing Open Sources Practices to the Educational
   Enterprise`_
-  `Introduction to z3c.form`_
-  `The Big Green Button: Turning Plone into a dynamic site factory`_
-  `Collective Good: Best Practices for Creating, Releasing and
   Maintaining Add-on Products for Plone`_
-  `Why Through-The-Web Development Isn't`_
-  `Relational database applications with Plone and SQLAlchemy`_
-  `Reaching Deployment Nirvana Using Buildout`_

Remarkably, some of these newly added videos are *still* relevant **and** enjoyable to watch, as are many of the ones already available in the easily browsable `archive`_.

My sincerest apologies to the community and especially to those whose videos were amongst this group for the delay, you should not have had to wait 2 days let alone over 2 years!

Thus, I now declare `Plone Conference 2008`_ to be wrapped. Thanks to Sean Kelly for the `help transferring the video`_ to plone.org.
