**My response**

My response to `http://blog.ziade.org/2011/12/20/new-year039s-python-meme-2011/`_.

It was fun `answering in 2009`_, so I thought I'd play again.

**What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2011?**

`Pyramid`_. In early 2011 I released `vanity`_, which later became `pythonpackages.com`_\ (more or less). I used building the site as an excuse to learn Pyramid, and it was well worth it.

**What new programming technique did you learn in 2011?**

I learned to **not** reinvent the wheel, and to collaborate with others on solving hard problems (which in and of itself is hard). Long story short, I took a little bit of heat within the Plone CMS community for creating a "one off" migration script:

- `http://pythonpackages.com/info/parse2plone`_

I've since learned my lesson and have been collaborating meaningfully with `Dylan Jay`_\ on the more widely-supported `mr.migrator`_ and friends.

**What’s the name of the open source project you contributed to the most in 2011? What did you do?**

I contributed to the `Plone`_ project quite a bit (as I have been doing for years now), but I also fell in love with `Mozilla`_ (and their mission) and began working on various things, including a virtual machine to help with the development of `support.mozilla.com`_:

- `https://github.com/aclark4life/kitsune-vagrant`_

**What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2011?**

`Hacker news`_. I have the start-up bug.

**What are the three top things you want to learn in 2012?**

JavaScript, JavaScript, and JavaScript. I first heard the term 15 years ago and have been avoiding it ever since. Time to jump in.

**What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2012?**

I hope someone (me) writes a "secret" feature for `pythonpackages.com`_ and launches it in first quarter of 2012; and I hope folks find it useful.
