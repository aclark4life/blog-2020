Collective.transmogrifier Without Plone?
========================================

**Yes!**

Since I began drinking the `collective.transmogrifier`_ Kool Aid a few months back, I've gotten quite excited about the possibility of being able to use it outside Plone, i.e. like "regular" Python people would do.

It just so happens I have a current project that requires me to import content to Plone 2.5; it took me a while to realize I could just setup a Plone 4 instance, run transmogrifier in it, and import content from it (i.e. from the file system) to Plone 2.5 over XML-RPC. But something about having to include Plone 4 in that scenario rubbed me the wrong way: Plone 4 is not needed, it's just executing the pipeline.

*(I also don't like the idea of having to create a Python package and a GenericSetup profile in order to facilitate a migration.)*

Goals
-----

So in addition to working on getting `mr.migrator`_ to be able to configure and execute pipelines (currently only GenericSetup profiles and Python code are supported), I thought I'd experiment with removing the CMFCore dependency.

The initial, *experimental* results can be seen in action here:

-  `https://github.com/aclark4life/mr\_migrator\_demo`_

From the `README`_:

::

    Introduction
    ============

    This demo is:* Proof of concept for mr.migrator: A tool that provides the ability to
    register and execute collective.transmogrifier pipelines without creating a
    Python package. It's Miller Time™.* Also proof of concept for collective.transmogrifier with the CMFCore
    dependency removed (and a zope.component dependency added in its place).
    It's Scotch time™.

    Explanation
    -----------
    In order to work, it currently relies on:* https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.transmogrifier/branches/aclark-mr-migrator-compat
    * https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/transmogrify.filesystem/branches/aclark-mr-migrator-compat
    * git@github.com:aclark4life/transmogrify.ploneremote.git These are, respectively:* A branch of c.transmogrifier with a setuptools entry point plugin system
    added, and the CMFCore dependencies removed (gracefully, I hope).* A branch of t.filesystem with the collective.transmogrifier entry point
    specified (and some CMFCore dependencies removed).* A fork of t.ploneremote with the collective.transmogrifier entry point
    specified (and some CMFCore dependencies remove).
    …

It's a work in progress, but it actually imports content. You may try it locally, as explained in the rest of the `README`_:

    Installation
    ------------
    You can try out this demo::

        $ git clone git@github.com:aclark4life/mr_migrator_demo.git
        $ cd mr_migrator_demo
        $ python bootstrap.py
        $ bin/buildout

    Elsewhere, setup a Plone site listenining on localhost:8080 with a Plone site
    object called "Plone" and then:    

        $ bin/mr.migrator

    You should end up with content in Plone that looks like this:
    …

I hope this helps move the state of the art forward a bit; it would be great to share this technology with the rest of the Python world. And in case you are curious about the changes, you can read the revision log here:
