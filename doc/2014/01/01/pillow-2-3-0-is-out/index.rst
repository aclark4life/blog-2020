Since Pillow 2.0, the Pillow Team has adopted a quarterly release cycle; as such, Pillow 2.3.0 has just been released. Here's what's new in this release:

Thanks to everyone who contributed fixes to 2.3.0, especially Eric Soroos AKA "wiredfool" who is officially now "Pillow Man #2" [1]_.

Handbook
--------

Additionally, we've forked the PIL handbook and have included it with our documentation here: http://pillow.readthedocs.org. Special thanks to Stephen Johnson AKA "irksep" for working on this.

Distributions
-------------

Lastly, I'm very grateful to Christopher Gohlke for producing Windows Egg, Exe, and Wheel distributions to accompany each source release. I suspect Christopher will produce his 2.3.0 distributions any second now at which point I will upload them to PyPI via `twine <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_.

Enjoy Pillow 2.3.0! And please report any issues you find here: https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow/issues
