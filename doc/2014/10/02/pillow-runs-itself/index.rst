Pillow Runs Itself
==================

**As of Pillow 2.6.0, the Pillow project almost completely runs itself!**

Of course when I say "runs itself" I mean "runs without me", which is what **every open source project lead hopes for**. For the first time ever, I was able to:

- Turn off GitHub Watching until two weeks before the release.
- Not run `setup.py upload` or `twine upload` myself.
- Watch in awe as Pillow Men #s 2 & 3 did all the work. [1]

Kudos to these gentlemen for making my life easier and for continuing to provide the Python community with a featureful, modern & secure Python Imaging Library. Additionally **thanks to all the contributors from all over the world** who continue to develop and improve Pillow. I used to keep a list, but now there are `too many to keep track of <https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/graphs/contributors>`_. Oh and lastly, `2.6.0 is out <https://twitter.com/wiredfool/status/517382632267841536>`_! Enjoy the release & please `report issues here <https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues>`_.
