Hello Plone Again

**I'm back!**

Regarding my recent "Goodbye Plone" post:

- It's come to my attention that the style of my departure post, and associated actions, may be perceived poorly. I'm sorry. This was not my intention, and I apologize if I've upset anyone. The Plone Community deserves the best, so let me see what I can do to address this.

- Several folks have reached out to express their concern about my departure, I appreciate this very much.

- While I stand behind my need to distance myself from such conflicts, I don't want to give the Plone Community or the outside world the wrong impression.

So, let me say this: I'm thinking about what happened today, and I'm going to comment about it in the future. I.e. after 24 hours or so. Regardless of future updates, please consider me: "around in some capacity, but not as fully engaged for personal reasons". This is an attempt to revert my abrubt departure, while at the same time not fully re-engaging until such time as I can determine the best course of action. Note that above all, and aside from my personal and professional goals, I don't want to be disruptive to the community if I can help it.

Thanks for reading.
