Plone Secrets: Episode 2 - Collective Python Buildout

**You know who uses the (Plone) Collective Python buildout?** 

You know who uses the (Plone) Collective Python buildout? Me neither, because we don't have any good statistics on its use (that I know of).  If it were a Python package, we could at least `count the number of times it has been downloaded`_.

You know who should use it? Everyone.

*[dramatic pause…]*

OK maybe not everyone, but at least everyone that regularly develops with **multiple versions of Python**. Here's why.

Actively maintained
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check out the log. It has been going strong for over 3 years.

If I recall correctly, it was born out of the frustration¹ of having to compile Python on Mac OS X Leopard. Python *never* compiles correctly on new versions of OS X (which is a complete mystery to me given that Apple ships with Python, don't they think people will want to compile it?).

Easy to install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got Subversion? Then you *can haz* the Collective Python buildout². You will also need to bootstrap it with whatever Python version you happen to have laying around. I won't go into detail about this; but suffice it to say depending on your OS, one of the following or something like it should work:

::

    $ aptitude install python2.5

Or:

::

    $ brew install python

If you are on Windows, give up (unless you have a Microsoft C compiler). Sorry.

Now, check out the code from the repository (if you are a member of the `Collective`_ and may potentially contribute something back, make sure you use https):

::

    $ svn co http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/buildout/python

Next, bootstrap and run the buildout:

::

    $ cd python
    $ python bootstrap.py -d
    $ bin/buildout

That's it. The buildout should go merrily on it's way compiling Python 2.4 through 3.2. When it finishes, you can install it in /opt (or wherever you like) with the following command (you might need sudo):

::

    $ bin/install-links

Then you should see:

::

    $ /bin/ls -1 /opt/local/bin
    easy_install-2.4
    easy_install-2.5
    easy_install-2.6
    easy_install-2.7
    easy_install-3.2
    pip-2.4
    pip-2.5
    pip-2.6
    pip-2.7
    pip-3.2
    python2.4
    python2.5
    python2.6
    python2.7
    python3.2
    virtualenv-2.4
    virtualenv-2.5
    virtualenv-2.6
    virtualenv-2.7
    virtualenv-3.2

Easy to configure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can add **/opt/local/bin** to your environment PATH variable.  This will make it easy to choose a particular Python, PIP, or Virtualenv at your leisure.

Unfortunately, if you pip install something, it will end up in the checkout instead of */opt/local/bin*.

To get around this, I usually pick one Python for daily use, and add its bin directory to my environment PATH variable:

::

    $ echo $PATH | tr ':' 'n'
    /sbin
    /usr/sbin
    /usr/local/bin
    /opt/local/bin
    /Users/aclark/Developer/collective/python/python-2.7/bin
    /usr/bin
    /bin
    /sbin
    /usr/X11/bin

After various pip installs, my 2.7 bin directory contains the usual tools of the trade:

::

    $ /bin/ls -1 /Users/aclark/Developer/collective/python/
    python-2.7/bin
    __dotcloud_git_ssh
    activate
    activate.csh
    activate.fish
    activate_this.py
    bfg2pyramid
    checkoutmanager
    cloudservers
    dotcloud
    easy_install
    easy_install-2.7

Wrap it up, I'll take it

That's it! There is not too much more to say, other than I hope you find this post useful and will consider using the `Collective Python buildout`_.

Of course, comments are always welcome.
