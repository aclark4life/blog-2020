You're So Vain, So Why Not Use Vanity?
======================================

**A few months ago I created a package called Vanity**

A few months ago I created a package called **Vanity**\ [0] that provides easy access to package download statistics from **PyPI**. You can find the source code here: `https://github.com/aclark4life/vanity`_.

I love this tool, and I use it all the time to gauge the value of a package. Of course, downloads are only one criteria you can use to judge the value of a package, and arguably not even a very good one.  **Vanity** itself is a good example of this phenomenon. I find it incredibly useful, but in it's history it has only been downloaded *130* times.

Other packages I have created with much less value have been downloaded more times, e.g. **plonetheme.aclark\_twitter** which has been downloadedÂ  *674* times. But that package has also been around much longer. So obviously another useful metric would be the *time period* during which the downloads occurred.

Anyway, here is how it works:

::

    $ easy_install vanity

Then:

::

    $ vanity <package>

For example:

::

    $ vanity vanity
    Package `vanity` has been downloaded 130 times!

Or:

::

    $ vanity plonetheme.aclark_twitter
    Package `plonetheme.aclark_twitter` has been downloaded 674 times!

Some of my other favorites:

::

    $ vanity Django[1]
    Package `Django` has been downloaded 302111 times!

::

    $ vanity zope.component
    Package `zope.component` has been downloaded 210541 times!

::

    $ vanity pyramid
    Package `pyramid` has been downloaded 26067 times!

Another thing to consider is if hitting **PyPI** each time is really necessary. I'm told there is **PyPI** data living somewhere else, and in future versions I would like to make vanity use that data by default.

So, this post is simply to announce **Vanity** to a wider audience in the event that some folks may find it useful. Otherwise, I will be happy to continue to watch **Vanity** downloads crawl ever so slowly towards 200.
