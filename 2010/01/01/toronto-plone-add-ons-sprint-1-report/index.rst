**Via Toronto Plone Users Group**

Last month, members of the `Toronto Plone user's group`_ helped with Plone.org maintenance. Here is the sprint "report out" from Jordan Baker:

Toronto Plone Addons Sprint Report #1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Attending: Robert Jackiewicz, Jordan Baker, John Southern, aclark
- aclark helped out by answering some questions and provided a dump of PSC data from `plone.org`_
- Rob was working on getting his buildout working with nginx and documenting the process
- John worked on gettting a task listing setup on coactivate: `http://www.coactivate.org/projects/ploneorg-upgrade/tasks/tasklist/show/993`_
- Jordan commited changes to allow for filtering by version, autosubmit on selection change and searching using the PSC view instead of the Plone search view.  aclark is working on cutting a release...  hopefully we can get a preview soon..

Outstanding questions:
----------------------

- need some help with c.xdv or nginx so we can preview changes in the theme
- Where should we put our issues in the future.  There was talk of eating dog food using a Poi instance on `plone.org`_ -- can someone help me set that up (add hexsprite and gogojohn as admins)
- Please help us by prioritizing the tasks in the task list on coactivate

Next Sprint:
------------

Shooting for January 22.  Hopefully that will work for most people.  Please help us spread the word to interested parties... more details to come.
