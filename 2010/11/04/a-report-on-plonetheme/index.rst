A Report On Plonetheme.*

**Plone Theme Buildout**

By now, most of us are familiar with XDV and how awesome it is for theming Plone (or any website). You should also be aware that XDV has been renamed to **Diazo**, and collective.xdv is now called **plone.app.theming**. But let us not forget the humble "old style" theme just yet! Sometimes they come in very handy, and may even be preferable in some cases depending on what you are trying to accomplish. I just gave **plonetheme**.\* a quick spin and thought I'd share the process and results with anyone that might find it useful.

Step 1
------

Get a list of all the **plonetheme** packages on PyPI:

::

    $ pip search plonetheme

Step 2
------

Create a buildout:

::

    $ virtualenv plone-theme-test
    $ bin/easy_install zc.buildout
    $ bin/buildout init

Step 3
------

Edit your buildout.cfg to include the following:

::

    [buildout]
    extends = http://dist.aclark.net/buildout/plone/4.0.x/buildout.cfg
    parts =
     plone[plone]
    eggs +=
     ${theme:eggs}zcml +=
     ${theme:eggs}[theme]
    eggs =# Deps that the themes should have added
     collective.contentleadimage
     collective.flowplayer
     z3c.jbot#    Products.categorynavigator
    #
    # XXX Products.categorynavigator is a dep of plonetheme.mvob but it

Step 4
------

Run buildout; start Plone; play around!

Conclusion
-----------

The whole effort (including writing the blog post) took only an hour or two, for whatever that is worth (not including the actual theme review, unfortunately!). I find the results interesting and I thought you might too.

Process
-------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll notice in the **[theme]** section, comments about various packages that were not included with all of the various themes.

As far as I can tell, it is in the best interest of "old style" theme developers to specify these packages in their setup.py files with the install_requires parameter!

OK, it's actually in my best interest because then I have to do less work, but you get the idea.

Broken or missing packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **plonetheme**.\* packages that are just commented out (without an XXX note) did not make it past the bin/buildout step (for whatever reason, usually a broken package).

Themes
------

My favorite theme (right after plonetheme.aclark\_twitter, that is) is… nevermind! I wanted to report on that but I still have to go through all the themes! (By installing each one at a time, testing, then uninstalling before moving to the next one.)

Packaging
---------

Just my opinion, but if you are adding functionality to Plone, it's probably not (just) a theme. So I would separate that functionality from your **plonetheme**.\* code.

Problems
--------

jbot modifies default Plone theme?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've noticed this before in both Plone Classic and now Sunburst when jbot is installed. No idea what the actual cause is:

Disclaimer
----------

Designed for Plone 4?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you say it (I know you are thinking it), I know not all of these themes are designed to work with Plone 4. I dont' have a good answer about how to approach that problem (I just know that when looking for themes, I don't really care. I just "want it to work".)

Bug report please?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know, I know. I should open a ticket for the jbot thing.

And now off to play!

P.S. I will report on the install process in the comments.

So far, *Andreas* installed, worked, and looked nice while *Bluegray Theme 1.0.0b2* required a ZMI undo ;-)
